## Linked artifacts

<!-- For feature work, link the Spec Kit artifacts this implements. -->

- Spec: `specs/NNN-feature/spec.md`

## Constitution check

<!-- Delete any row that does not apply to this change. -->

- [ ] **I. Manifest** — every path referenced by `extension.yml` exists
- [ ] **II. Namespacing** — command names match `speckit.{id}.{command}`, no core shadowing
- [ ] **III. Placeholders** — no `CUSTOMIZE:` markers survive in a package
- [ ] **IV. Hooks** — new hooks are `optional: true`, or the auto-execute is justified here
- [ ] **V. Script parity** — bash and powershell variants both present
- [ ] **VII. Install-test** — `add --dev` → `list` → run commands → `remove` passed locally
- [ ] **VIII. Versioning** — version bumped and `CHANGELOG.md` updated in this change
- [ ] **IX. English** — every file in this diff is written in English
- [ ] **XII. Distribution** — if releasing, the published ZIP was installed from its release URL

## Notes for the reviewer

<!-- Anything that would be hard to infer from the diff. Trade-offs, things
     you deliberately left out, follow-ups you plan to open separately. -->
